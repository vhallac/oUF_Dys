A customized and extended version of oUF_Lyn.

The following additional features are available:
* A decursive-like raid frame for easy cleansing
* A bar-like player debuff display for low CPU usage
* Boss Frames (not tested yet)

Party and raid frames were removed from the original layout. I use oUF_Grid instead (see "vhallac/ouf_grid":http://github.com/vhallac/ouf_grid).

There were many changes to the way things are handled, and the source code has diverged a lot from oUF_Lyn since I started.
